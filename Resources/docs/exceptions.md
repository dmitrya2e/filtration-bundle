# Exceptions

[Return to the documentation index page](index.md)

If you need to catch FiltrationBundle exceptions, you can rely on **Da2e\FiltrationBundle\Exception\BaseException** class, which extends standard \Exception class.

Each bundles' internal exception class extends this BaseException. Exception classes have quite logic and relevant structure under /Exception/ directory (Da2e\FiltrationBundle\Exception namespace, respectively), so you can check the full tree of exceptions in this directory if you wish.
